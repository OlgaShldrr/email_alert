Hi `r params$name`!

As of `r today()`, these units have resubmitted data. They were assigned to you, have a look!

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#display the schools by user
event_alert %>% 
  filter(user==params$name) %>% 
  select(UnitID, 'Unit Name', 'Date When Completed') %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling()
```
